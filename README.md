# HTML_Examples
> Example files to test HTML5 features

This repository contains HTML files used to test and exemplify different HTML(5) features.

## Usage

This is a collection of *samples* developed during the lectures of the  [**Web Engineering course**](https://people.disim.univaq.it/~dellapenna/content.php?page=students). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 13th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

Just open the HTML files!
